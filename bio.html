            <h2 id="head">Company Bio</h2>;
            <p id="para1">WhatTheFunnn Games was created in early 2019 as a project and new endeavor during the beginning of Covid19 outbreak.
            WTF Games has seen less activity in the recent year due to changes, but is promising a return in early 2022. Date to be determined. (keep checking back for updates) 
            </p>;
            <h2 id="head">Personal Bio</h2>;
            <p id="para2">WhatTheFunnn AKA Dan S. is a 31 year old gamer who is aspiring to start coding. He plans to take his coding career to further his streaming career and build a new career in software engineering. Currently he is engaged and soon to be married in the coming June of 2022. He has 2 cats as his only heirs named Artemis Moon and Emerald White Fang, whom tend to be the apples of his eye and also the nightmare in his sleep.(If you have cats you understand, that's all I'm going to say.)</p>;

            <h2 id="head">Kitties</h2>;
            <p id="para3">Both cats were adopted in 2018; found on the street and abandoned at 3 weeks old. Dan S, was offered them by a friend and nursed them into good health. They are living their best lifes terrorizing him to no avail.
                
                Emerald White Fang, a ferious beast in a tiny little body. The beast with green eyes is insanely cute, but will make even the most veteraned cat handler terrified to be in the same room with her. (watch out) She is very playful but loyal to only one.
                <br><br>
                Artemis Moon; a talkitive, loveable, oaf who will tell you his whole life story and make sure you know that he's there. A siamese by no other name, whom would have great feats in life other than the "Aristocats". He is fun loving and learned to trip Dan S. back as a game they play every morning while make the morning cup of Jo.
